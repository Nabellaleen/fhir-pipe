# Get started!

To standardize data with the pipe, you need some data! Let's set up a database filled with the MIMIC III Clinical Database Demo.

## Configure MIMIC demo dataset credentials

First, register [here](https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/demo/) on the official website to get access to the demo data, it takes 30 seconds and you'll set a username and a password. This will be needed to download the data.

Then copy `.env.example` into `.env` and edit this last to configure it with yours physionet credentials.

## Build the database docker

This will download the data sources and load its to the PSQL database. The logs should give you hints
if anything is going wrong.

```
docker-compose up mimic-db
```

To check if data are well loaded, you can execute this in a new terminal :

```
$ docker exec -ti fhir-pipe-mimic-db psql -d mimic -U mimicuser -c 'SELECT count(subject_id) FROM patients'
 count
-------
   100
(1 row)
```

You can then shutdown the database with `ctrl-c` or with `docker-compose down mimic-db`

In case of troubles, note that the setup scripts are executed only if the PSQL database is empty.
To clear the previously build dockers and databases to re-start from a clean state, please run :

```
docker-compose down mimic-db
docker volume rm fhir-pipe-mimic-db
```

And, after that, if you have to re-build the docker (for example to take into account the values setup in `.env` file), please run :

```
docker-compose build mimic-db
```

Et voilÃ ! Let's now standardize this database in the FHIR format!

## Setup the fhirbase

Get the image and fill the database

```
docker pull fhirbase/fhirbase:latest

docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -d fhirbase/fhirbase:latest

docker exec -it gallant_varahamihira /bin/bash

psql

CREATE DATABASE fhirbase;

\q

# Fill the db

fhirbase -d fhirbase --fhir=3.0.1 init

fhirbase -d fhirbase --fhir=3.0.1 load /bundle.ndjson.gzip

exit
```

> How does this relates to the container defined in the docker-compose.yml ?

## Run the pipe

Run locally the pipeline. You should already have the docker containers with mimic and fhirbase running.
```
fhirpipe-run --project=Mimic --resource=Patient --main-table=Patients --use-graphql-file=True
```

Remove `--use-graphql-file=True` to get the latest mapping rules from the pyrog project.
