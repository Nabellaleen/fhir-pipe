# Get started!

To standardize data with the pipe, you need some data! Let's set up a database filled with the MIMIC III Clinical Database Demo.

## Configure MIMIC demo dataset credentials

First, register [on the Physionet website](https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/demo/) on the official website to get access to the demo data, it takes 30 seconds and you will get a username and a password. This will be needed to download the data.

Then copy `.env.example` into `.env` and edit this last to configure it with your physionet credentials.

```
cp .env.example .env
source .env
```

## Build the database docker

This will download the data sources and load its to the PSQL database. The logs should give you hints if anything goes wrong.

```
docker-compose up mimic-db
```

To check if the data has been correctly loaded, you can execute this in a new terminal :

```
$ docker exec -ti fhir-pipe-mimic-db psql -d mimic -U mimicuser -c 'SELECT count(subject_id) FROM patients'
 count
-------
   100
(1 row)
```

You can then shutdown the database with `ctrl-c` or with `docker-compose down mimic-db`

In case of troubles, note that the setup scripts are executed only if the PSQL database is empty.
To clear the previously build dockers and databases to re-start from a clean state, please run :

```
docker-compose down mimic-db
docker volume rm fhir-pipe-mimic-db
```

And, after that, if you have to re-build the docker (for example to take into account the values setup in `.env` file), please run :

```
docker-compose build mimic-db
```

Et voilÃ ! Let's now standardize this database in the FHIR format!

## Setup the fhirbase

Get the image and fill the database

```
docker pull fhirbase/fhirbase:latest

docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -p 5433:5432 -d --name fhir-pipe-fhirbase fhirbase/fhirbase:latest

docker exec fhir-pipe-fhirbase psql -c "CREATE DATABASE fhirbase"

# Fill the db

docker exec fhir-pipe-fhirbase fhirbase -d fhirbase --fhir=3.0.1 init

docker exec fhir-pipe-fhirbase fhirbase -d fhirbase --fhir=3.0.1 load /bundle.ndjson.gzip
```

> How does this relates to the container defined in the docker-compose.yml ?

## Install the pipe locally

You should install it in an isolated virtual environment, by using virtualenv or Pipenv for example.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

 Make sure you already have the docker containers with mimic and fhirbase running.

Copy `config_demo.yml` into `config.yml` and put there your credentials

```
cp config_demo.yml config.yml
```

Run the tests to check all works fine
```
python setup.py test
```

## Run the pipe

Let's now run locally the pipeline!

You are all set! Run:

```
fhirpipe-run --project=Mimic --resource=Patient --main-table=Patients --use-graphql-file=True
```

Remove `--use-graphql-file=True` to get the latest mapping rules from the pyrog project.

Check fhirbase to see if the data was correctly loaded:

```
psql -h 0.0.0.0 -p 5433 -U postgres -d fhirbase

fhirbase=# select count(*) from patient;
```
